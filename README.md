## University Assignment 2 under Machine Learning Subject (BITI2223)

Upon creating this repo and uploading the code, it has been quite some time since I coded this. During that time, I was relatively new to python. I may forgot how this works. Hehe..
  
For this assignment, I was tasked to implement a reinforcement learning. I made a simple game that AI can learn. So, I made a game similar to The Dinosaur Game (basically just knockoff version of that game). This time, the golden block is the Dino while the red block is the obstacle

## Environment
### Agent
The agent is the golden block / Dino itself

### Observation
The dino is able to see types of obstacle as well as the distance between the Dino and the Obstacle (when it gets near)

### Action
The Dino

### Reward
Everytime the Dino is able to pass the obstacle, it will get the reward.

### Punishment
Everytime it gets hit on obstacle, it will receive punishment.

## Results
